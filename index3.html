        <p class="question1 q3" id="q1">If you pull the lever: the diverted train will run over 15 random people, and all their friends and family are shouting at you to divert the train, claiming it is the more utilitarist thing to do. However, if you kill your best friend your life will loose its worth.</p>
        <p class="question2 q3" id="q2">If you don't divert the train: your best friend, who you cherish with all your heart and is your unique comrade, will die and the loneliness will make you hugely depressed. Nevertheless, in case you kill the 15 people, your life in the society is over.</p>
